## TODO

- Adding tests for all solved puzzles
- Accrediting the user from whom I got the inspiration for the puzzle solver "game" layout
- Preparing for year 2022
- Making a decent readme, including information about how to run/play the "game"
- .NET Framework 4.8 --> .NET 6 (started in branch `dotnet6` in 2021... useful?)
