## TODO

- Fixing erroneous code for:
   - Year 2021, Day 14 (part 2: test fails for both real and example input)
   - Year 2021, Day 18 (part 2: test fails for example input)
   - Year 2021, Day 21 (part 2: test fails for example input)
- Cleaning up `2021` branches with erroneous code; determining which code snippets may be worth keeping
- Accrediting the user from whom I got the inspiration for the puzzle solver "game" layout
- Making a decent readme, including information about how to run/play the "game"
